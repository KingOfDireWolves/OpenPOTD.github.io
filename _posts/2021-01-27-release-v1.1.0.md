title: Release 1.1.0
---



This release introduces the new rating feature, with `rate_difficulty`, `rate_quality`, and `rate_random`; or `rd`, `rq` and `rr`. These allow you to rate problems and the bot aggregates data in an ELO-style ranking system which allows for comparison of quality and difficulty between different problems. 

Minor bug fixes were also made in this release.
